      <description>R and Python are two examples out of many coding languages.R and Python have the ability to talk to each other in chunks, meaning it is possible to use R markdown with Python code chunks inside. Many professionals have a language they prefer to code in, and the ability to use more than one language in R studio simplifies the process switching between the two.
Below are Python chunks within R markdown.</description>

      <description>R Markdown I selected three datasets from Gapminder. The first dataset, “calories” gives the average daily caloric intake of an adult, per country and per year. The dataset “sugar” gives the average quantity of sugar and sweeteners eaten per day (in grams), per country and per year. The third dataset, “life” gives the average life expectancy, per country and per year. These datasets were interesting to me because I am interested in nutrition.</description>
